Hi everyone,

I'm having some trouble with my Java program. It's supposed to read a file 
and output each line with line numbers, but instead, it's throwing some unexpected 
output and errors. Here's the screenshot:

I'm guessing it might be an issue with how the file is being read, possibly a path issue? 
But I'm not sure why it read some lines correctly. 
The input causing the failure seems to be the file reading part, but not sure what's 
specifically wrong.

Thanks for helping.
